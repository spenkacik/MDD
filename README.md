Hello! My name is Samuel Penkacik. Welcome to my MDD project! I really hope everything works as it should and you have fun playing with it.


My web page for this project is called CodeExter (short for CodeExterminator). It is a message board style site very similar to StackOverflow.com. It is a place where people can post questions about web development bugs they are having, and other more experienced users can comment on their posts with ideas for how to exterminate the bugs. I built the app using FuelPHP and Scaffolding for frameworks. The API incorporated is a Facebook login feature.

Installation instructions:

1. Download zip archive from GitHub.

2. Put CodeExterminator folder in your "MAMP/htdocs" folder.

3. Go to "http://localhost:8888/CodeExterminator/public/entry" in your browser.

the SQL dump for the database is in the Assets folder. If the site works as I hope it does, you should be looking at the CodeExter home page. CodeExter is built to utilize the Facebook log-in API. If you are logged into Facebook already you should see a welcome message with your name in the top right, if you are logged out of facebook, it will ask you to log in.

Have fun exploring!
